# checkrail

A code generation tool written in Haskell for the creation of clients and servers based on an OpenApi3 description.

This tool is heavily inspired on [guardrail](https://github.com/guardrail-dev/guardrail) for Scala and aims to generate
code for at least [Pursuit](https://www.purescript.org/) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).
